;; Create URLs for files and commits in GitHub/Bitbucket/Gitorious/...
;; repositories. `git-link' returns the URL for the current buffer's file
;; location at the current line number or active region. `git-commit-link'
;; returns the URL for a commit. URLs are added to the kill ring.

;; With a prefix argument prompt for the remote's name. Defaults to "origin".
